//! This library contains utility functions for calculating paycheck withholdings and net income given a hypothetical hourly wage and weekly working hours. The idea is pretty much like the "Sample Paycheck" tool found in the [Paycom](https://www.paycom.com/software/employee-self-service/) employee portal, but aimed at having a little more functionality and customization.
//!
//! The entire library was developed with the perspective of an hourly paid employee in mind, focusing on bi-weekly paychecks as the standard pay period to simulate how employees typically view and plan their income.
//!
//! The primary question this library aims to answer is: "Given an hourly wage and number of hours worked per week, what would my net paycheck be after taxes and deductions?"
//!
//! The secondary question this library aims to answer is: "Given a total monthly expenses amount and hourly wage, how many hours would I need to work to cover my expenses with "x" amount left over after taxes and deductions?" (this will be implemented in a future version).
//!
//! The library is structured into several modules:
//! - `withholdings`: Contains functions to estimate federal tax withholdings, Social Security, and Medicare deductions.
//! - `deductions`: Defines structures and functions for handling pre-tax and post-tax deductions.
//! - `income`: Contains functions to calculate gross paycheck based on hourly wage and hours worked.
//! - `expenses`: Defines structures and functions for managing monthly expenses.
//! - `utils`: Contains tax and time related constants necessary for calculations.
//!
//! A CLI will be implemented in a future version to allow a user to input their hourly wage, hours worked, filing status, deductions and expenses to see their estimated net paycheck and other relevant financial metrics.
